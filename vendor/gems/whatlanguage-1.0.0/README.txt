== DESCRIPTION:
  
Text language detection. Quick, fast, memory efficient, and all in pure Ruby. Uses Bloom filters for aforementioned speed and memory benefits.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
  
* Only does French, English and Spanish out of the box. Very easy to train new languages though.
* It can be made far more efficient at the comparison stage, but all in good time..! It still beats literal dictionary approaches.
* No filter selection yet, you get 'em all loaded.
* Tests are reasonably light.

== SYNOPSIS:

  Full Example
    require 'whatlanguage'
    
    texts = []
    texts << %q{Deux autres personnes ont été arrêtées durant la nuit}
    texts << %q{The links between the attempted car bombings in Glasgow and London are becoming clearer}
    texts << %q{En estado de máxima alertaen su nivel de crítico}
    texts << %q{Returns the object in enum with the maximum value.}
    texts << %q{Propose des données au sujet de la langue espagnole.}
    texts << %q{La palabra "mezquita" se usa en español para referirse a todo tipo de edificios dedicados.}
    
    texts.each { |text| puts "#{text[0..18]}... is in #{text.language.to_s.capitalize}" }

  Initialize WhatLanguage with all filters
    wl = WhatLanguage.new(:all)

  Return language with best score
    wl.language(text)

  Return hash with scores for all relevant languages
    wl.process_text(text)

  Convenience method on String
    "This is a test".language   # => "English"
